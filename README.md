# **SillinessLimiter**

## Description

SillinessLimiter is a little strange ip to name lock, but the one that provides more freedom to the player

Mainly for the offline servers, because login:password are miserable

Meant to be used somewhere else, but left unused, so I decided to finish it and make it public

## Commands

-- limits your name to ip address you are currently on, however if you have op or access to console, you can limit someone to specific ip by arguments

#### _/silly-unlimit_
